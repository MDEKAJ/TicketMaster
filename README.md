# Met's Notes

- Styling; basic material ui layout for perspective. If I was to copy the ticket master site I would used styled component library Aurora by ticketmaster.
- Aurora relies on the react, prop-types, react-transition-group, classnames, and styled-components peer-dependency packages are already to be installed and set up in your project. // I think 'to be' needs to be removed from this sentence right?
